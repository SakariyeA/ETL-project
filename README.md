# ETL-project
Data Sales Analytics (Databricks)
The goal of this project is to build an ETL pipeline to analyze retail sales data, providing insights into sales trends, customer demographics, and high-performing products or regions. By the end, you should have a pipeline that ingests, processes, and loads data into a structured format for reporting and visualization.
